title: A taste of some hillwork

**Route:** Cemetary - Terwilliger - Downtown - Tabor x 3 - Home

**Weather:** Cold, dry, and heavy overcast

**Ride Partners:** none

No [team](http://www.hammervelo.com) ride for me today, as Nancy had a breakfast with friends who are in town. Ultimately, I think this worked out in my favor, because I need to really spend some time developing my own base miles at my own pace. Today gave me the opportunity to do just that as I rode quite a few smaller hills around the central Portland area.

I forgot how much thinking I can get done on a solo ride. One of the thoughts that my mind grabbed onto is the effect of a lack of a structured schedule on our family. Breaks from school and work are great on the surface. However, now that we've been out for a week, the girls are ready to be back in school and I feel like I haven't really accomplished anything that I've wanted to accomplish so far. This is the irony of my job in a high school. Students and teachers alike look forward to breaks, but then they don't really know what to do with those breaks. I know that my riding is much less consistent during the summer break than at any other point during the year. Still, today, I was thankful for the time to be out riding on a _dry_ winter day in Portland.

All said, the legs felt pretty good. If I can keep up the consistancy, I may be able to round into form for the spring races.

**Total distance:** 24.5 miles
