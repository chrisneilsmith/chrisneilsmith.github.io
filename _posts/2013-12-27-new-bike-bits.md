title: New bike bits
---

No ride today, but still some bike-related business. I made a trip down to [Portland Bicycle Studio](http://portlandbicyclestudio.com/) to pick up some new mud flaps for my fenders. They sell a really nice set of long flaps that will almost reach the ground from my rear fender. I'm sure that teammates will really appreciate them on our winter training rides. After that, I made a stop at [River City Bicycles](http://rivercitybicycles.com/) to pick up a replacement tire to replace the one that got cut up so badly yesterday.

At home, I was able to get the new tire on and the new rear flap installed before the cold drove me inside. While I'm not looking forward to the real rainy season here in Portland, I do feel like the bike is at least ready for it.
