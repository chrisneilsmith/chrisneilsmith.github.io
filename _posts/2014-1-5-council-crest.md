title: First ride to Council Crest of the year
---

**Route:** Council Crest - RCB - Home

**Weather:** Sunny and _cold_

**Ride Partners:** Curtis Loeb

The Sunday team ride got cancelled today because of ice. Apparently, yesterday at least three people went down because of ice on the Saturday Hammerfest, so Jeff Tedder made the call to cancel today's ride. I definitely think it was the right call.

That said, Curtis shot me a text after church, and after the temperature had warmed up a little, asking about a ride with him up to Council Crest. I took a couple days off the bike after the [New Year's Day ride](http://chrisneilsmith.github.io/2014/01/01/new-years-day-team-ride.html), but I spent about an hour on the trainer yesterday. Yesterday's trainer time gave me enough confidence to at least give it a shot today. It also didn't hurt that I know Curtis' form is just a little better than mine right now.

I piled on quite a few warm clothes and headed out into the bright winter sun. We paced ourselves up through the cemetary, and I felt okay. Not great, but better than I had felt on the 1st. Then, cruised Terwilliger until we hit the Chart House and turned up. The climb from the Chart House to Fairmont was a definite grind, but we kept the pace down and that helped. I still could feel the effort in my back which means that I need to force myself to work on my core strength some more. Once we hit Fairmont, the temperature was quite a bit colder and we had to take it easy, as there was still ice in the shady places.

While we were a little worried about the ride down, it proved no problem as the pavement was really dry. Afterwards, we made our way through downtown and made a short stop at River City Bicycles for a coffee and a little warmth before we took the Springwater back to Sellwood. All said, it was definitely a step in the right direction. A half-dozen more like it and I might start to get some form back.

**Total distance:** 25 miles or so
