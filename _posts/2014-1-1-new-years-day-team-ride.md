title: New Year's Day Team Ride
---

**Route:** Redland Rd. Loop

**Weather:** Cold, clear, and foggy in places

**Ride Partners:** 20+ Hammer Velo riders & friends

On my ride down to Water Ave. Coffee to meet the team, I knew it was going to be a tough day on the bike. I have not felt good lately, and today was no different. Even the slight breeze that was in my face as I headed north kept the pedals from turning easily.

Still, it was great to see a big group out for the first team ride, and the first ride period, of the new year. On the rollout down the Springwater Trail, that headwind on the way down there became a bit of a helping tailwind. Conversation was good and it took my mind off the lack of legs and the lower abdominal pain I've been battling. However, once the speed picked up on River Road, I knew that I didn't have the legs for the full ride. I hung in until Gladstone and then peeled off.

It turns out the group got after it pretty good, so I'm sure that I made the right choice. I did pick up some PSA Caps from Jeff later in the day, and I'm hopeful I'll get things straightened out in the next week or so. Otherwise, I'm very thankful that I got out for a dry ride on New Year's Day here in Portland.

**Total distance:** 25 miles
