**Route:** Oregon City -- Hwy. 43 -- Tryon Creek -- Terwilliger -- Downtown -- Home

**Weather:** Sun to start, heavy fog, and _cold_

**Ride Partners:** none

I got out for  a short ride yesterday, but before that I have not been on my bike outside in more than a week.

On my ride yesterday and today, I found myself thinking a lot about Irene Bond's article [Wheels of Truth](http://redkiteprayer.com/2014/01/wheels-of-truth/) on the Red Kite Prayer website. Towards the end of her piece, Bond writes:

The truth, for me, is that I have used the bike to not think about what's in front of me, and I've used it to help me process what I'm going through. I have spent a lot of time of the bike lately. Probably, too much. Too many days I have felt just as Ms. Bond describes in her article, "I woke up with the intention of riding, looked at the bike, and didn’t." Time off the bike has helped me figure out what I've needed to figure out. However, the problem with being off the bike for any amount of time is that it makes getting back on it a humbling experience. Even though it is January, I know that my fitness is nowhere near where it should be at any point in time.

Such feelings kept me from the team ride yesterday. I had no desire to be shot out the back instantly on the first race-pace ride of the year. Today, however, I decided to venture out on my own. it was one of those days where I riolled out with no idea of where I was headed or how far I wanted to go. I decided to head south down River Road. I realized quickly that this was not the best decision as I quickly rode out of the sun and into a dense fog that made the temperature a good 6-8 degrees cooler.

Before the ride, I lowered my seat just a millimeter or two, as I have been having some pain behind my left knee. I also really focused on my right leg and its pedal stroke. Both of these adjustments helped, and I found my pace. It was by no means fast, but it felt right. And, that was encouraging.

I felt good through the middle of the ride and made the decision to extend it after I climbed up through Tryon Creek. I knew my legs were tired, but I also knew that I needed to push myself if I was ever going to recover any sort of decent riding form. Ultimately, I paced myself up and over Terwilliger. The only problem was that the decent into downtown left me really cold. I had also neglected to bring along anything to eat or eat lunch before I left. This combination left me near bonking. Fortunately, I was able to make it back to the Springwater Trail without that happening.

I certainly didn't set any Strava records, but I was back on the bike and I ended with more miles than I had expected. Hopefully, I can get a few commutes in this week and start stringing together a few more of these baby steps.

**Total Distance:** 30 miles

**Feet climbed:** 1,500+
