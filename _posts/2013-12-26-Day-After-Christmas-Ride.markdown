**Weather:** Clear and cold. About 39 degrees F when we rolled out.

**Ride Partners:** Drew Coleman

I have not been on the bike much at all for the last three weeks. After indulging on both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, I needed to burn some calories today. The plan was to get some base miles in with Drew and ride out to [Kelly Point Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelley_Point_Park).

We rolled out and hit a lot of traffic on the Springwater Trail, which is to be expected on such a nice day in the middle of winter. All was going well until I managed to impale my rear tire on small metal rod laying on the side of Lombard. After a boot job and tube change, we opted to cut the ride short so Drew could get home on time. We cruised up Columbia until we got to Interstate. We did manage to find a nice path called something like the Kenton Sidewalk. I appreciated getting away from all of the traffic on Columbia.

The ride ended up being 32.5 miles door to door. I was very thankful to have borrowed a thermal vest from Drew. It kept me from being really cold. Still, the toes were plenty cold by the time I got home.
